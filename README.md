# ChessGameETL
This project is a multi-module Scala ETL pipeline using Apache Spark to process chess game data. It reads raw CSV files, transforms and enriches the data (e.g., timestamps, ratings), and writes processed results. Modules include shared models, transformation logic, and ETL orchestration.
